# JOIN -->
- It is used it to between the data from more than 1 table and distinct it.

## Classification :-    

1. CROSS JOIN/CARTESIAN JOIN
2. INNER JOIN/EQUI JOIN
3. NATURAL JOIN
4. OUTER JOIN
    
    - LEFT OUTER JOIN

    - RIGHT OUTER JOIN

    - FULL OUTER JOIN
5. SELF JOIN

---

### 1. CROSS JOIN/CARTESIAN JOIN :-
- This join will merge all the record of one table with all the records of an another table.

### Syntax:-
- <U>IMPLICIT</U>
    - `SELECT */COL_NAME/EXPRESSION
        FROM TAB_NAME 1,TAB_NAME 2`

- <U>EXPLICIT</U>
    - `SELECT */COL_NAME/EXPRESSION
      FROM TAB_NAME 1 CROSS JOIN TABLE NAME 2;`

### EXAMPLE :-
    SELECT *
    FROM EMP, DEPT;

    SELECT *
    FROM EMP CROSS JOIN DEPT;

### NOTE: 
- Since partition join produces more number of error records it is not used any industry to overcome this advantage we use `Inner or, Eque join`    

---

### 2. INNER JOIN/EQUI JOIN :-
- It is used it to retrive only the matching records from the given two tables.

### Syntax:-
- IMPLICIT

        SELECT */COL_NAME/EXPRESSION
        FROM TAB_NAME 1, TAB_NAME 2
        WHERE <JOIN CONDITION>
- EXPLICIT

        SELECT */COL_NAME/EXPRESSION
        FROM TAB_NAME 1 INNER JOIN TAB_NAME 2
        ON <JOIN CONDITION>
